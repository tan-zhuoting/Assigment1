# This is a project for PIC 10C class 
This a single-player version of the card game known as 'siete y medio' (seven and a half), which is very similar in nature to the casino game of Blackjack (also known as 21).
The project is not nessary a working program code, but need to show that I know how to use version control

## Tested functions:
	operators of Hand class.
	empty() of Hand class.
	set_bet() of Player class.
	Player constructor.
	etc. see commits for details in changes.
- I have created an 'experimental branch'
- I have manually made a merge conflict where a line was deleted on 'master' but edited in 'experimental'. 
The conflict is resolved by having 'master' revert its deletion on that line.
- I have created the '.gitignore' file for C++
- I have checked for the existence of binary files and be caution that they should be deleted in the repository

Afterall, I gained a basic idea of version control and how to implement it in the process of coding.
